Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujaykapadnis/every-known-satellite-orbiting-earth

Proposed inferential questions:
- The mean mass of satellites owned by US entities is greater than the mean mass of all satellites.
- The proportion of satellites with an inclination greater than 45 degrees is different between satellites owned by US and Chinese entities.
- The mean period of satellites in geostationary orbit is greater than those in low earth orbit.
